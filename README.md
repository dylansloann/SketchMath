## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This was a personal project I embarked on. The idea came from the desire to test out deep learning. Inspiration for the digit recogintion came from various sources.

### Features
* Uses TensorFlow for training reconigition data & OpenCV for reformatting written digit for comparison.
* Utilizes MNIST digit classification
* Can perform and output mathematical computations on 2 user drawn numbers.
* Offers the fully integrated QuickPaint software (self made drawing application)
